      <p>Spike is an open source project that brings concurrency and
      distribution to the largest Functional Brain Simulator currently
      in existence. The simulator, <a href="http://www.nengo.ca">Nengo</a>,
      is a project developed by the
      <a href="http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/index.html">Computational Neuroscience Research Group</a>
      at the Centre of Theoretical Neuroscience at the University of
      Waterloo. The simulator is used to run
      <a href="http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/stewart2012c.html">
      Spaun</a> (Semantic Pointer Architecture: Unified Network),
      a network of 2.5 million
      spiking neurons. Given such large scale simulations, the simulator is extremely
      slow at performing computations. For instance, to calculate a second of
      data for Spaun, it requires hours of computation. </p>

      <p>Spike aims to improve the performance of the simulator by taking
      advantage of the modularity of the simulator components. In Nengo, the
      simulator executes all the components of the simulation sequentially.
      Spike, on the other hand, draws a clear separation between the components
      and useses message passing to communicate between them. The redesign
      then allows the components to be executed in parallel and distributed.</p>

      <p>Nengo is originally a Java simulator. However, there are multiple
      versions of the simulator written in various languages. Spike uses
      a python implementation, which takes advantage of Numpy and Theano
      libraries. The communication is done over TCP using a fast transport
      protocol <a href="http://www.zeromq.com">0MQ</a>.</p>

          <h2>The Administrator</h2>
          <br \>
          <p>A user script defines a model to be simulated. Running the script
          initiates the Administrator, the primary point of the simulator. The
          administrator creates nodes for every group of neurons in the model
          and establishes desired connections between them. The administrator
          also creates worker interfaces for the nodes. The interfaces are the
          gateways for communication between the nodes and the administrator.
          When the nodes are ready, the distribution manager sends the node
          definitions to available machines to be executed.</p>

          <h2>The Worker Daemons</h2>
          <br \>
          <p>The machines on the network run a daemon. The daemon is used for
          incoming node definitions. Once it receives a definition, the
          daemon spawns a new process for the node.</p>

          <p>Nodes communicate using TCP connections. Each node sends its
          outputs to the outgoing nodes and receives inputs from incoming nodes.
          Nodes communicate with the admin for synchronization - nodes know
          when the simulation has started and the admin needs to know when
          it finished.</p>

          <p>Probes are special kinds of nodes. They are coupled with some
          node in the network and collect all the outputs of the node. The
          data that probes collect is then used for simulation analysis.</p>

          <h2>The Distributed Simulator</h2>
          <br \>
          <p>This is the complete architecture for the distributed simulator
          so far. The user's machine executes the administrator. The nodes
          from the model are distributed by the administrator across the
          available machines. During execution, nodes have blocking receives
          and non-blocking sends. Thus nodes compute as long as inputs are
          ready.</p>
